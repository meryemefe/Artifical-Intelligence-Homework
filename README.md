# Artifical-Intelligence-Homework

There are two homework related to CS 461 Artificial Intelligence course.

The first one is river problem which is very typical in AI. A group consisting of 3 cannibals and 3 missionaries seeks to cross a river. A boat is available which will hold up to 2 people. If the missionaries on either side of the river are outnumbered at any time by the cannibals on that side, even momentarily, the cannibals will do away with the unfortunate, out-numbered missionaries. In the first assignment, it is proved that 4 cannibals and 4 missionaries cannot be taken safely across a river with a boat holding only 2 people.

The second one is an artifical intelligence which is created by using alpha beta pruning algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe game.
